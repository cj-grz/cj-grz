## Hi there, I'm Justin Valdez 👋  
🚛 Entrepreneur | 🤖 ML Enthusiast | 📊 Data Strategist | 🌎 International Business  

👨‍💻 **About Me**  
I thrive at the intersection of logistics, data science, and AI. With over 27 years of family experience in the freight industry and a background in Mechatronics and International Business, I bring a unique perspective to solving real-world operational problems using machine learning and optimization. My work ranges from predictive analytics in transportation to neural networks for supply chain design.

Whether it's automating diesel tracking across a 35-truck fleet, or building custom neural networks to optimize Production Routing Problems, I love applying AI to make businesses more efficient.  

<br>

🌱 **Always Learning**  
I’m continuously expanding my skills in machine learning, full-stack development, and business strategy. Lately, I’ve been diving into deployment (Flask, Android apps), advanced optimization (CPLEX), and CRISP-DM methodology to solve industry problems end-to-end.  

<br>

🔭 **Current Focus**  
- Deploying AI-powered apps for internal logistics tracking  
- Scaling machine learning models to real production systems  
- Exploring cross-border freight expansion into the U.S. market  
- Designing digital strategies for internationalization (e.g., ChocoArte & Agua Pura de Jalisco projects)  
- Building custom dashboards using Google Sheets, SQL, and Power BI
